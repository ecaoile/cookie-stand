Week 2 Project for Code Fellows 201 Course - Cookie Stand
This project contains two pages: an index.html and sales.html

Index.html is the main page customer-facing page that shows advertised products and provides background info on Pat's Salmon Cookies. It contains a navigation menu at the time with static positioning. Images provided by the 201 instructors were used as required by the project. Conceptually there are about 4 "decks of cards" on this page: the nav element, the merchandise list, the background info, and the footer with the contact info.

Sales.html is the behind-the-scenes page for the employee. There is a table of random values for each store. A form is available to add a new store. When the new store is added, it is appended to the row, and the table is recreated with the new store at the bottom of the list. The code is designed to retain the origin values of the already-listed stores after adding the new store. There is also input validation in order to prevent negative values and blank fields. Functionality on adding a is not complete as there is no way to retain the added data upon refresh. I suspect some kind of PHP would be necessary.

Code for the nav menu was taken from the following URL: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp
